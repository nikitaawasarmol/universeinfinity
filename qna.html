        <h3> The toilet, the shower, your bed at 3am. Thease are some of the places which spawn some of the weirdest thoughts and
        questions, to the extent of thinking yourself that if someone were read your mind you would be locked away in 
        lunatic asylum.</h3><br>

        <h1>Q1. If you pump helium in your butt will your fart be high-pitch ?</h1>
        <div>
        <p> First of all helium makes your voice pitch higher because is changes how fast the sound generated by vocal chord 
        vibration travels through yourr voice box, which leads to a higher pitch. Now if you performed the experiment 
        it wouldn't sound high pitch. This is because the vibration by fart is caused by the **you know** which is on the 
        outside as compared to vocal chords. So unless you've got vocal chords in your butt, your fart will sound normal.</p>

        <h1>Q2. Can flu be eliminated if every human is quarantined for few weeks ?</h1>
        <div>
        <p> First of all such a quarantine would make the global economy crash harder than bitcoin ever did. Also that would 
        be entirely useless because viruses and bacteria can survive for centuries outside hosts. But even if everyone 
        became anti-social and isolated themself for few hundred years it would still be in vain. Because the influenza 
        virus can also spread through other animals.</p>

        <h1>Q3. Why does the the human mind ignore the second "the" ?</h1>
        <div>
        <p> Unless you aren't fluent in English you shouldn't have noticed the second "the". This happens because your eyes 
        take in more words at the same time and the brain doesn't analyse each word individually. So unless a word is 
        new or require some mental work to process, your brain won't fully analyse it. There is also this phenomenon 
        called "attentional blink" where if the brain is presented with several identical successive stimuli, your brain 
        will percieve them as a whole.</p><br><br>

        <h1>Q4. Is it legal to project something onto someone's house ?</h1>
        <div>
        <p> What if you suddenly had a burning wish of watching a meme compilation on a very very big screen ?  What does the 
        law says about the projection on buildings ? Is it considered vandalism which means an act invoking delibrate 
        destruction or damage to public or private property ? A projection is just a bunch of photons thrown at wall,
        it's neither destruction nor damage. It doesn't really stick to walls. The law doesn't say anything related to 
        this. So as long as your projection aren't offensive you can so it.</p>

        <h1>Q5. If you get a vocal chord transplant will you sound like the donar ?</h1>
        <div>
        <p> Thats probably not gonna work. The most defining trait of your voice are created by the way your throat muscle 
        work. The shape of your sinus is also very important. There is even a good chance that you'll still sound like 
        yourself even after the implant.</p> <br><br>

        <h1>Q6. If you go in space and take Elon Musk's Tesla car would it be considered theft ?</h1>
        <div>
        <p> If you actually manage to do that, I'm sure Elon would start to worship you. But say he hide a dead body in the 
        space costume and he doesn't want anyone to find out. Can he legally stop you from taking his car ? You could 
        try and argue that the car was abondoned and thus the car isn't his anymore. By the law you can reposses anything 
        that is abondoned. But earth law doesn't really apply to space.</p> <br><br>

        <h1>Q7. How will our universe die ? </h1>
        <div>
        <p> Here is one of the most asked question. So here we'll first talk about what will happen to universe in next 
        billions of years. The universe appeared 13.8 billions years ago. If we compress that time to just 1 year 
        the homosapiens have been around for only 6 seconds. And only in a matter of miliseconds you made your only home 
        look like a rotten wasteland. In the following century humans will either go extinct or become an interplanetary 
        civilization, that will spread throughout the universe. and become the universe's way of experiencing itself, 
        possibly become godlike being. Although extinction is more likely. But no matter what happens to humans, the 
        universe will keep evolving. <br><br>

        - Around 100,000 years from now all stars will will change their place and so there will be no more constellations,
        as they'll become unrecognisable. <br><br>

        - In 1 million year the star Betelgeuse will go super-saiyan and will be visible during daytime with naked eyes.<br><br>

        - In 10 million years most of the current species on earth will either go extinct or evolve in completely different 
        one's. <br><br>

        - 100 million years later probably a huge asteroid the size of the one that destroyed dinosaurs will hit the earth.
        But I highly doubt if we lived for 100 million years. Even if we survived we couldn't stop it. Also no more rings for 
        saturn. <br><br>

        - In 250 million years all the continent will fuse togeother thus forming Pangaea Ultima. Also solar system will 
        complete its first revolution around the milky way galaxy. <br><br>

        - In the next billion years the sun will get a bit more mad thus evaporating earths all oceans, killing most of 
        the terrain life.  And a bit later our galaxy will colide with Andromeda galaxy thus forming Milkdromeda. <br><br>
        
        - Then the sun will become a red giant and eat earth and 3 others just in time before moon would have colided 
        with earth. However if we managed to survive this long we'll probably save earth by dragging it away. After killing 
        the planets Sun will shrink down to a White dwarf the size of the earth. <br><br>

        - In 100 billion years from now due to expansion of the universe, all other galaxy will disappear from the universe
        and because of the cooling of microwave background - it will become undetectable. Any intelligient civilization 
        at this point will think that our galaxy is the only one in the entire universe. <br><br>

        - 1 trillion years from now, all the galaxies will deplete of gas clouds and thus formation of new stars would be 
        impossible. All of the hydrogen in the stars core will exhaust and slowly the star will start to die. <br><br>

        - In 20 more trillion years, all star in the universe would have exhausted, even the red dwarfs, whole life span is 
        1500x longer than our sun. The only remaining star like objects in the universe would be white dwarf, neutron star And
        black holes. <br><br>

        - 1 quadrallion years from now all planets would be detached from the solar system because of close stellar 
        encounters. <br><br>

        - In 100 quantillion years from now if the earth survived the red gaint phase, it'll swirl inside a known as
        black dwarf sun because of the decay of its orbit. <br><br>

        - 10<sup>30</sup> years All the remaining stellar remnant that were not ejected from the galaxy will now have 
        fallen in central galactic black hole. All atomic nuclie decay and if proton decay, the black hole era of 
        universe begins in which black holes would be the only remaining celestial object in the entire universe. 
        The only way to survive for any civilization in this time is to orbit a black hole and utilise its energy which 
        is released in form of Hawing Radiation. <br><br>

        - 10<sup>106</sup> years. By now all the black holes would have been evaporated and universe enters the dark era in 
        which all physical objects have decayed to subatomic particles. In case proton decay is not possible, all the 
        particle will fuse togeother thus forming Iron-56 isotope and thus creating something called as Iron stars. Also 
        this period of time is equal to this 10<sup>1500</sup> years. <br><br>

        - Around 10<sup>10<sup>40</sup></sup> all particles would have converted into black hole which would evaporate 
        almost instantaneously. Now the universe is truly a void with nothing inside it. Now the universe has reached its 
        final energy state with maximum entrophy. <br><br>

        After this nothing will ever happen. But there is still hope. There would still be virtual particles in that 
        empty void which who knows may give birth to another big bang. <br><br>

        This is one possibility which is called <b>The big rip</b>. 
        In another possibility opposite will happen. The expansion rate of universe will slow down over time and 
        gravity would start to take over. Everthing then would we played in reverse and all the objects of the 
        observable universe would be collected at one single point and maybe it'll give birth to another big bang. </p>

        <div>
        <h1>Q8. What if we fall inside a black hole ?</h1>
        <div>
        <p> First lets see how a black hole is formed. A start is constantly fusing Hydrogen intoo other elements mostly 
        helium but later also lithium, silicon, neon and oxygen. This is called Nuclear Fusion and it produces a force 
        which stops a star from collapsing it itself. After some billion years the stars starts to produce Iron. 
        Stars can't fuse element heavier than iron as because of lack of force generated by nuclear fussion, gravity 
        starts to take over. Small stars like our sun will probably become red giant, eat earth and become a white dwarf.
        However stars more massive will start to shrink increasing in density. Electrons would be forced to combine 
        with protons thus forming neutrons ans the core will become a neutron star. Because of some complicated stuff 
        the outer layer of the star is ejected into space with a energy that can outshine an entire galaxy. All that is 
        left is either a neutron star or a black hole. If density of neutron star is 400 quadrallion kg/m<sup>3</sup>
        then density of a black hole is : infinity. To be precise thats the density of the sigularity - the centre of 
        black hole. It also has 0 volume probably. In theory you can convert anything in a black hole if you compress 
        it hard enough. That region is called Schwarzschild Radius. For eg. We need to compress earth to 9mm or sun to 3km 
        to get a black hole.</p> <br><br>

        <h3> Now lets see what happens if we jumped in.</h3> <br><br>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/cNTq53T/index4.jpg"  alt="Image Unavailable"/  class="image5"><br><br>

        <h3> ...but lets see what we'll see before dying.</h3> <br><br>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/721tbRD/index5.jpg" alt="Image Unavailable"/  class="image6"><br><br>

        <p> As we approach we see the light is distorted around the black hole because its gravity. All the light coming 
        from the back of the black hole is getting distorted and as a result we can see even beyond it. As we advance 
        we can see a bluish colour. This is because light trying to escape black hole have a shorter wavelength 
        corresponding to blue part of spectrum. At the photon sphere, theoretically we could see ourself by looking sideways 
        as the light relected from us goes around the black hole and arrives back at us. As you fall more inside the black 
        hole things will start to speed up. Hundreds of will rise and fall in seconds for you due to Time Dilation. Billions 
        of years will pass while you'll be falling in the black hole. The gravitational force will me more stronger at your 
        feet than your head so you'll be stretched like spaghetti. Thus it is called Spaghettification. As you fall more 
        and more after crossing event horizon you'd see border between universe and black hole change with place and 
        universe becoming a sphere. This happens because all the incomming light will fall forming a circle and it will get 
        smaller and smaller until it disappers. Then we'd be left with everlasting darkness and only way would be to 
        arrive at singularity. At singularity no one knows what will happen. Scientist couldn't merge theory of 
        relativity with quantum theory. But if a black hole is rotating black hole (also called as Kerr Black Hole) due 
        to its centrifugal force it wouldn't be able to form a singularity. Instead there will be a ring of low gravity. 
        So you might be transported to another place in universe or another universe or in another time.</p> <br><br>

        <h3> - So that's what will happen before you die in a black hole. </h3>

        <h1>Q.9 What is the shape of our universe ?</h1>
        <div>
        <p> Before telling what is the shape of our universe lets see how many shapes universe has ? Universe has 3 shapes 
        Atleast thats what we consider. They are :</p> <br><br>
        <div class="points">
        1. Open Universe<br>
        2. Closed Universe<br>
        3. Flat universe</div><br><br>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/7JpbzhN/index11.jpg" width="700" height="400" alt="Image unavailable"/  class="image7"><br><br>

        <p> Now how do we measure that a universe is flat or not ? We simply take 2 distinct galaxies and then measure the 
        angle formed. Now,</p> <br>
        <div class="points">
        <ul>
            <li>If addition of all 3 angles is > 180<sup>0</sup> then the universe is open</li>
            <li>If addition of all 3 angles is < 180<sup>0</sup> then the universe is closed</li>
            <li>If addition of all 3 angles is = 180<sup>0</sup> then the universe is flat</li>
        </ul>
        <p> In our case the angle came to be equal to 180<sup>0</sup>. This has 2 meanings.</p> <br><br>
        1. Our universe is flat.<br>
        2. The curvature of an open or closed universe is so small that we cannot detect it.<br><br></div>

        <p> But the evidence that makes our universe flat is the universe is expanding. Unless we are not living in a 
        simulation only a flat universe is allowed to expand. However the Cosmic Microwave Background is oval shapped.</p> <br><br>

        <h1>Q10. Will technological Singularity will us or make us immortal ?</h1>
        <div>
        <p> First of all lets see how fast the pace of human invention has speed up. Only one hundred years ago wright brothers 
        created first aircraft, now we want to colonise mars. In last 50 years microprocessor became billion times 
        more advance, transistors shrinking from 10000 nm (size of human hair) to just 10 nm (size of haemoglobin). 
        Also $1 was worth 1/10th of a calculation per second. Now $1 is worth 1 billion times more than that. So we have this 
        dude one of the most well known futurist of our time Ray Kurzweil with an prediction accuracy of 86%, who says that 
        by 2045 the processing power of computers will allow them to become artificially intelligent. To stimulate a 
        human brain you need 10 quadrallion calculations per second. The fastest supercomputer till date Chinese Tianhe2 
        has a speed of 33.8 quadrallion calculations per second. The hardest remaining thing is to recreate the human 
        algorithm of human indelligence inside the computer.</p> <br><br>

        <h3> This shows how much humans have progressed in tecnological field since 1400's. </h3> <br><br>

        <p> Before we get there, we have 3 types of AI or Artificial Intelligence :</p> <br>
       <div class="points">
        1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence : <br>
        Its the one that is specialised in one area like driving a car, a chess player. If you tell to unify the general 
        theory of relativity and quantum mechanics it wil simply stare blank at you. <br><br>

        2. Artificial General Intelligence : 
        This one is bit smatter. Maybe even bit smarter than humans. It can do pretty much what a human does. We don't yet have 
        thease but we're pretty close. <br><br>

        3. Artificial Super Intelligence : <br>
        Pretty much God. This one is millions or billions of times smarter than whole humanity combined. <br><br>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/G38cHrZ/index9.jpg" alt="Image Unavailable"/  class="image10"><br><br>
        <h3> This is the difference in intelligence of human and ASI.</h3> <br><br>

        If it becomes reality we only have 2 paths : <br>
        1. Extinction <br>
        2. Immortality<br><br>
       </div>

      <p> To become as intelligent as human it could take somehwhere between a year and a decade. After that its 
        intelligence can grow 100 times in just few hours. So is there any way we can control this thing ? Maybe put it 
        on a secure server without access to internet ? Remember it thousand times if not million times greater than 
        all humans. It'll probably hypnotize the scientist with a ultra low frequency sound and giving it access to internet. 
        It is stupid to even think of controlling something that is more evolved that humans by the factor of millions. <br><br>

        Now what if this god is a nice god ? If this happends it'll be the best thing happened to humanity ever. Even 
        bigger than the discovery of fire. Almost everything would be possible. It would revert the climate changes, invent 
        new ways of harvesting energy, colonise the entire galaxy and probably give us immortality. It could do it by 
        inserting billions of nanobots inside our body that would constantly repair and replace the damaged cells. Also it 
        could upload our consiousness to internet so that we can become like it. <br><br>

        On the other hand if it turned out to be a bad god, it'll be worst thing happening to  humanity ever. It would 
        almost certainly lead to extinction. And it would do it because of some hatred towards us, rather it would see a 
        threat in humans. It would probably know that humans could turn it off and it wont want that. So can we code some 
        safety instructions to not kill us all ? The thing is, it is super intelligent. It doesn't give a shit what we tell it 
        to do. The only way might be to shut down the whole internet, which will be something worst than WW2. But then it'll 
        create some sort of private network to live in. <br><br>
        
        Reguardless of this if we tent to create this artifical intelligence, it'll probably be the last invention of 
        humanity.</p>
