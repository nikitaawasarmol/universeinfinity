        <h1> 1. God Particle</h1>
    </div>
    <p> God Particle is the informal name of Higgs Boson. The Higgs boson is an elementary particle 
    in the Standard Model of particle physics, produced by the quantum excitation of the Higgs field, one of the fields 
    in particle physics theory. It is named after physicist Peter Higgs, who in 1964, along with five other 
    scientists, proposed the Higgs mechanism to explain why particles have mass. This mechanism implies the existence 
    of the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson was initially discovered as a new particle in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS 
    collaborations based on collisions in the LHC at CERN, and the new particle was subsequently confirmed to match the 
    expected properties of a Higgs boson. Higgs Boson falls in the category of scalar boson which indeed is a part of 
    Standard Model of Particle Physics. <br><br></p>

    <h3>Candidate Higgs boson events from collisions between protons in the LHC. The top event in the CMS experiment shows 
    a decay into two photons (dashed yellow lines and green towers). The lower event in the ATLAS experiment shows a 
    decay into four muons (red tracks).</h3><br>

    <p> The higgs Boson is said to be God Particle because it is believed that it was the first particle 
    that was created just after the universe was born. So its termed as God Particle. Everything in the universe is
    comprised of this elementary particle higgs boson.</p> <br><br>

        <h1> 2. Elementary Particles</h1>
    </div>
    <p> The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory describing three out of four known 
    fundamental forces (the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, and not including the gravitational force as 
    its not yet discovered) in the universe, as well as classifying all known elementary particles. It was developed in 
    stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists around the world, with the 
    current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. 
    Since then, confirmation of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added 
    further credence to the Standard Model.</p><br><br>
    <p> There are various subdivisions in the Standard Model Of Particles. Here are they explained :</p> 
    <div class="points">
    <ol>
        <div class="s1"><li>Up Quark - <br>
        It is one of the fundamental particle that makes up almost all the atoms that you can see in the universe. 
        It is the lightest of all quarks and is a major constituent of matter. Up quark with down quark forms neutron and 
        protons. It is the part of 1st generation of matter. It is a part of elementary fermions a subdivison in the 
        table. has an electric charge of +2/3 e and a bare mass of 2.2+0.5 −0.4 MeV/c2. Like all quarks, the up quark is 
        an elementary fermion with spin 1/2, and experiences all four fundamental interactions: gravitation, 
        electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions.
        <br><br></li></div>
    
        <div class="s2"><li>Down Quark - <br>
        It is another fundamental particle which with the Up quark makes up almost all the atoms that we see. It is the 
        2nd lightest of all quarks. It is part of the first generation of matter, has an electric charge of −1/3 e and a 
        bare mass of 4.7+0.5 −0.3 MeV/c2. Like all quarks, the down quark is an elementary fermion with spin 1/2<br><br>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Proton_quark_structure.svg/1200px-Proton_quark_structure.svg.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Image Unavailable"/ class="image2"><br>
        <h3>This shows that 2 up and 1 down quark makes up all the protons and neutrons. And they're held togeother by 
        gluons</h3><br>
        <br></li></div>
        
        <div class="s3"><li>Charm Quark - <br>
        Charm Quark or c-quark is 3rd most massive of all quarks. They can only be observed in particle accelerators.
        They are also found in hadrons (made up of quarks). It along with strange quark is a part of 2nd generation of 
        matter and has a electric charge of +2/3e. It experiences all the 4 fundamental interactions. has an electric 
        charge of +2/3 e and a bare mass of 1.275+0.025 , −0.035 GeV/c2. Like all quarks, the charm quark is an 
        elementary fermion with spin 1/2. It decays into strange quark.
        </li><br></div>

        <div class="s4"><li>Strange Quark - <br>
        As its name it is indeed strange. It hypothetically clump up into bits of strange matter and destroy and convert 
        anything they touch into strange matter.It is the third lightest of all quarks, a type of elementary particle. 
        Strange quarks are found in subatomic particles called hadrons. Examples of hadrons containing strange quarks 
        include kaons, strange D mesons, Sigma baryons, and other strange particles. Along with the charm quark, it is 
        part of the second generation of matter. It has an electric charge of −1/3 e and a bare mass of 95+9
        −3 MeV/c<sup>2</sup> Like all quarks, the strange quark is an elementary fermion with spin 1/2.
        <br></li><br></div>

        <div class="s5"><li>Top Quark - <br>
        Top Quark also known as t-quark is the most massive particle observed in elementary particles. The t-quarks 
        interact primarily by strong interaction, but can only decay through weak force. It decays into W-boson, either 
        a bottom quark or strange quark or rarest case down quark. It does not form hadrons. 
        Like all other quarks, the top quark is a fermion with spin 1/2 and participates in all four fundamental 
        interactions: gravitation, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions. It has an electric charge
        of +2/3 e. It has a mass of 172.76±0.3 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, which is close to the rhenium atom mass
        </li><br></div>

        <div class="s6"><li>Bottom Quark - <br>
        The bottom quark or b quark, also known as the beauty quark, is a third-generation quark with a charge of −1/3 e.
        The bottom quark has exceptionally low rates of transition to lower-mass quarks. The bottom quark is also notable 
        because it is a product in almost all top quark decays, and is a frequent decay product of the Higgs boson 
        </li><br></div>

        <div class="s7"><li>Electrons - <br>
        Electrons are the part of leptons in the elementary particle table. They aren't made up of anything. At absolute 
        zero they becomes extremely tightly confined and divide in 3 quasiparticles. <br>-Spinon<br>-Orbitions<br>-Holons<br>
        Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family. The electron has a mass that is 
        approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. 
        </li><br></div>

        <div class="s8"><li>Muon - <br>
        Muons are 200 times heavier than electron. You can replace electron with muon to create say Muonic Hydrogen.
        They can also help in developing cold fusion that is thermo-nuclear reactions at room temperature. It has an electric 
        charge of −1 e and a spin of 1/2. Because muons have a greater mass and energy than the decay energy of radioactivity, they are not 
        produced by radioactive decay. However they are produced in great amounts in high-energy interactions in normal 
        matter, in certain particle accelerator experiments with hadrons, and in cosmic ray interactions with matter. These 
        interactions usually produce pi mesons initially, which almost always decay to muons.
        <br></li><br></div>

        <div class="s9"><li>Tau - <br>
        The tau (τ), also called the tau lepton, tau particle, or tauon, is an elementary particle similar to the electron, with negative 
        electric charge and a spin of 1/2. Tau leptons have a lifetime of 2.9×10<sup>-13</sup> s and a mass of 1776.86 MeV/c<sup>2</sup> 
        (compared to 105.66 MeV/c<sup>2</sup> for muons and 0.511 MeV/c<sup>2</sup> for electrons). Since their interactions 
        are very similar to those of the electron, a tau can be thought of as a much heavier version of the electron.
        </li><br></div>

        <div class="s10"><li>Neutrino - <br>
        Nutrino are the smallest elementary particle than we've discovered till now. They are particles such that they 
        interacts only via the weak subatomic force and gravity. The neutrino is so named because it is electrically 
        neutral and because its rest mass is so small (-ino) that it was long thought to be zero. The mass of the neutrino 
        is much smaller than that of the other known elementary particles. The weak force has a very short range, the 
        gravitational interaction is extremely weak, and neutrinos do not participate in the strong interaction. Thus, 
        neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and undetected.
        <br></li><br></div>

        <div class="s11"><li>Gluon - <br>
        Gluons is an elementary particle that comes under Guage Boson. Gluons act as  an exchange particle for strong 
        force between quarks. In simple words they act as flux tape between up and down quark. There are 8types of 
        gluons. red-antired , red-antigreen , red-antiblue, green-antired , green-antigreen , green-antiblue ,
        blue-antired , blue-antigreen , blue-antiblue. It has spin 1 and electric charge 0.
        </li><br></div>

        <div class="s12"><li>Photon - <br>
        Photons are carrier of electromagnetic force. They are reason that you atr able to read this right now. They 
        exhibit wave–particle duality, their behavior featuring properties of both waves and particles. Photons are 
        massless and they always move at the speed of light in vacuum, 299792458 m/s.
        <br></li><br></div>

        <div class="s13"><li>W and Z Boson - <br>
        W and Z bosons are the carrier of strong and weak nuclear force. They are responsible for decay of particles. 
        The W<sup>±</sup> bosons have either a positive or negative electric charge of 1. The two W bosons are verified 
        mediators of neutrino absorption and emission. During these processes, the W<sup>±</sup> boson charge induces 
        electron or positron emission or absorption, thus causing nuclear transmutation. 
        <br></li><br></div>

        <div class="s14"><li>Higgs Boson - <br>
        The higgs boson or god particle is the reason particles having mass. Thinkk of higgs field as an ocean and 
        everything passes it has to push through the water to move. Some have to push harder. Thats why different 
        particle have different masses.

    <div class="head"><h1> 3. Anti Matter - </h1>
    </div>
    <p> Anti Particles is a material composed of anti-particles like anti proton ans anti electron.
    They have different quantum number and opposite charge. A laser drove through a gold target nuclie and caused the 
    incomming electron to emit energy quanta that decayed into both matter and anti-matter. Positrons were detected at 
    higher rate in greater density. The other particles like anti proton and anti neutrino were made in CERN's LHC. <br><br>
    When normal matter comes in contact with anti matter their collision give rise to intense photons, gamma rays and 
    neutrino. It also releases quite large amount of energy. This energy is proportional to total mass of collided 
    particle in accordance with Mass-Energy equivalance.</p>

    <p> Antiparticle pairs can annihilate each other, producing photons; since the charges of the particle and 
    antiparticle are opposite, total charge is conserved. For example, the positrons produced in natural radioactive 
    decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays, a process exploited in positron 
    emission tomography.Although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges, electrically neutral particles 
    need not be identical to their antiparticles. The neutron, for example, is made out of quarks, the antineutron from 
    antiquarks, and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other 
    upon contact. However, other neutral particles are their own antiparticles, such as photons, Z<sup>0</sup> bosons,
    π<sup>0</sup> mesons, and hypothetical gravitons and some hypothetical WIMPs.</p> <br><br>

        <h1> 4. Quantum Entanglement</h1>
    </div>
    <p> Quantum Entanglement is a phenomenon which occurs when a pair of group of particles are 
    generated or interacted in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the 
    state  of other, even when the particles are seperated by a large distance instead of quantum state must be described 
    for the system as a whole. In short the 2 particles are connected to each other such that affecting one particle 
    also affects the other as if they're entangled into each other.<br><br></p>

    <p> Measurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled 
    particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is 
    generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first 
    axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, will be found to be counterclockwise.<br>
    However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a property of a particle results 
    in an irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and will change the original quantum state. In the case of 
    entangled particles, such a measurement will affect the entangled system as a whole.</p> <br><br>

    <p> Gravitational Lens is distribution of matter betweeb distant light source and an observer that 
    is capable of bending the light from the source as it travels towards observer. This effect is called Gravitational 
    Lensing. The amount of bending is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein general theory of relativity. Unlike 
    a optical lens, gravitional lens produces maximum deviation of light that travels fuuther from its centre. It has no 
    focal points but a focal line. If the light source, the massive lensing object and observer lies in a straight line

    <div class="head"><h1> 7. Nebula</h1></div>
       <p> Nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, 
        the term was used to describe any diffused astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The 
        Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the Andromeda Nebula (and spiral galaxies in general as 
        "spiral nebulae") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, 
        Edwin Hubble and others. Most nebulae are of vast size; some are hundreds of light-years in diameter. A nebula 
        that is visible to the human eye from Earth would appear larger, but no brighter, from close by. The Orion 
        Nebula, the brightest nebula in the sky and occupying an area twice the diameter of the full Moon, can be viewed 
        with the naked eye but was missed by early astronomers. Although denser than the space surrounding them, most 
        nebulae are far less dense than any vacuum created on Earth – a nebular cloud the size of the Earth would have a 
        total mass of only a few kilograms. </p><br><br>

        <p> Black hole is a region in spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape 
        from its gravitational influence. Not even light. They are real life demons of the universe. A black hole is formed 
        after the star dies. If a star is small like our sun, then after running out of fuel it'll first expand into a red giant 
        while its core being contracted and then it'll become a white dward and not a black hole. But if a star is big enough 
        say alpha centauris then after it runs out of fuel then it'll expand and its core will keep contracting. Then it'll 
        arrive at a point where all the mass of the sun would get concentrated into the core and thus a star becomes a neutron 
        star whole density is much much larger than the original star. Now if the core still kept contracting even after 
        the neutron star is formed then a black hole is formed with an explosion. The density of an black hole is almost 
        infinity. <br><br></p>

        <p> The term quasar originated as a contraction of quasi-stellar [star-like] radio source, because 
        quasars were first identified during the 1950s as sources of radio-wave emission of unknown physical origin, 
        and when identified in photographic images at visible wavelengths they resembled faint, star-like points of 
        light. High-resolution images of quasars, particularly from the Hubble Space Telescope, have demonstrated that 
        quasars occur in the centers of galaxies, and that some host galaxies are strongly interacting or merging

        <p> A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which 
        originate from the solar wind, that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet's magnetic field. 
        Earth has two such belts and sometimes others may be temporarily created. The belts are named after James Van 
        Allen, who is credited with their discovery. Earth's two main belts extend from an altitude of about 640 to 
        58,000 km (400 to 36,040 mi)[1] above the surface, in which region radiation levels vary. Most of the particles 
        that form the belts are thought to come from solar wind and other particles by cosmic rays. By trapping the solar 
        wind, the magnetic field deflects those energetic particles and protects the atmosphere from destruction.<br><br></rb>
        The belts are in the inner region of Earth's magnetosphere. The belts trap energetic electrons and protons. Other 
        nuclei, such as alpha particles, are less prevalent. The belts endanger satellites, which must have their sensitive 
        components protected with adequate shielding if they spend significant time near that zone.<br></br></p>>

        <p>
        The arrow of time, also called time's arrow, is the concept positing the "one-way direction" or "asymmetry" of 
        time. It was developed in 1927 by the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, and is an unsolved general physics 
        question. This direction, according to Eddington, could be determined by studying the organization of atoms, 
        molecules, and bodies, and might be drawn upon a four-dimensional relativistic map of the world ("a solid block of 
        paper") if the fourth dimension is considered to be time itself. Physical processes at the microscopic level are 
        believed to be either entirely or mostly time-symmetric (which means): <br>
        if the direction of time were to reverse, the theoretical statements that describe them would remain true. Yet at 
        the macroscopic level it often appears that this is not the case: there is an obvious direction (or flow) of time.</p><br><br>          
        
        <div class="pr"><p> The symmetry of time (T-symmetry) can be understood simply as the following: if time were perfectly 
        symmetrical, a video of real events would seem realistic whether played forwards or backwards. Gravity, for example, 
        is a time-reversible force. A ball that is tossed up, slows to a stop, and falls is a case where recordings would 
        look equally realistic forwards and backwards. The system is T-symmetrical. However, the process of the ball bouncing 
        and eventually coming to a stop is not time-reversible. While going forward, kinetic energy is dissipated and entropy 
        is increased. Entropy may be one of the few processes that is not time-reversible. According to the statistical 
        notion of increasing entropy, the "arrow" of time is identified with a decrease of free energy</p></div><br><br>

        <p> A time crystal or space-time crystal is a state of matter that repeats in time, as well 
        as in space. There are following states of matter in universe :</p><br>
        <div class="points">

            <li>Liquid</li>

            <li>Time Crystal</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
        Normal three-dimensional crystals have a repeating pattern in space, but remain unchanged as time 
        passes. Time crystals repeat themselves in time as well, leading the crystal to change from moment to moment.
        If a discrete time translation symmetry is broken (which may be realized in open driven systems), then the 
        system is referred to as a discrete time crystal. A discrete time crystal never reaches thermal equilibrium, as 
        it is a type of non-equilibrium matter, a form of matter proposed in 2012, and first observed in 2017.</p> <br><br>

        <div class="pr"><p> Time crystals seem to break time-translation symmetry and have repeated patterns in time even if the laws of the 
        system are invariant by translation of time. Actually, studied time crystals show discrete time-translation 
        symmetry breaking: they are periodically driven systems oscillating at a fraction of the frequency of the driving 
        force. The initial symmetry is already a discrete time-translation symmetry ( t → t + n T ), not a continuous 
        one ( t → t <sup>′</sup>  ), which are instead described by magnetic space groups
        However, Floquet time crystals are unique in that they follow a strict definition of discrete time-translation 
        symmetry breaking</p></div><br>

        <p> The Unruh effect (or sometimes Fulling–Davies–Unruh effect) is the prediction that an 
        accelerating observer will observe a thermal bath, like blackbody radiation, whereas an inertial observer would 
        observe none. In other words, the background appears to be warm from an accelerating reference frame; in 
        layman's terms, an accelerating thermometer (like one being waved around) in empty space, subtracting any other 
        contribution to its temperature, will record a non-zero temperature, just from its acceleration. Heuristically, 
        for a uniformly accelerating observer, the ground state of an inertial observer is seen as a mixed state in 
        thermodynamic equilibrium with a non-zero temperature bath.It is currently not clear whether the Unruh effect has 
        actually been observed, since the claimed observations are disputed. There is also some doubt about whether the 
        Unruh effect implies the existence of Unruh radiation.</p> <br><br>

        <div class="pr"><p> The Unruh temperature, sometimes called the Davies-Unruh temperature[4], was derived separately by 
        Paul Davies and William Unruh and is the effective temperature experienced by a uniformly accelerating detector 
        in a vacuum field. It is given by<br><br>
        <b>T = (ℏa) / (2πck<sub>B</sub>)</b><br>
        where ħ is the reduced Planck constant,<br> a is the local acceleration,<br> c is the speed of light,<br> and k<sub>B</sub> is the Boltzmann 
        constant. <br><br>Thus, for example, a proper acceleration of 2.47×1020 m·s<sup>-2</sup> corresponds approximately to a temperature of 1 K. 
        Conversely, an acceleration of 1 m·s<sup>-2</sup> corresponds to a temperature of 4.06×10−21 K. </p></div><br><br>

        <div class="pr"><p> The Unruh temperature has the same form as the Hawking temperature <br><br> 
        <b>TH = ħg/2πckB</b> <br>with g denoting the surface gravity of a black hole, which was derived by Stephen Hawking in 1974. 
        In the light of the equivalence principle, it is, therefore, sometimes called the Hawking–Unruh temperature. </p></div><br><br>
