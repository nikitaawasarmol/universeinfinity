        <h2>The statement of the Liar's Paradox is - </h2> <br><br>

        <div class="pr">
        <p> The sentence itself is a paradox. Here everything is about the perception of words 
        true and false. In the above statement <b><i>"This sentence is false"</i></b> is true then the 
        statement is indeed false. That is if we see the statement as a whole it is true. 
        But speaking the content of the statement, what it implies is false. This is what we 
        call as <b> Liar's Paradox</b>. The antinomy of the liar is the statement of a liar that he or she is lying: 
        for instance, declaring that "I am lying". If the liar is indeed lying, then the liar is 
        telling the truth, which means the liar just lied </p><br>

        <h2> The Grandfather Axe Paradox states that -</h2> <br><br>
        <i><b>If you have your grandfather's axe. After using it for some time its head is
        chirped. So you replace its head with a new one. After some time its handle is 
        broken so you replace the handle as well. Now as the entire object is replaced piece 
        by piece does it truly the same object as in the question.?</b></i><br><br>
        </div>

        <div class="pr">
        <p> It is also called as ship of theseus paradox. It is a thought experiment that raises 
        the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains 
        fundamentally the same object. The concept is one of the oldest in Western philosophy, 
        having been discussed by the likes of Heraclitus and Plato by ca. 500–400 BC.</p><br>

        <br> 
        <p> I personally think that the answer to the paradox is NO. The object doesn't truly
        remain the same it was earlier. Because by replacing the object you are also removing
        the properties that the piece of object possessed before it was replaced. Say the head 
        of the before replacing had 80% Iron and 20% Copper then the replaced part may have
        70% Iron and 30% Copper. So it truly doesn't remain the same object. </p><br>

        <b><i>There are 2 twin brothers A and B. A goes on a spaceship which revolves
        around the earth at the speed near to speed of light and the other twin B stays on

        <div class="statement">
        <h2> One of the most famous paradox in the history, this paradox says that - </h2> <br><br>
        <b><i>"Suppose you have a time machine. Using that time machine you travelled 
        in past and killed your grandfather in his childhood before he met your grandmother.
        Now the thing is as you killed your grandfather, your father would never be born,
        which means you also you never be born. If you haven't born then you were not the one
        who build a time machine and gone to the past to kill your grandfather. Then the question
        who killed your grandfather ?"</i></b><br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="pr">
        <p> This is one the most mind blowing paradox ever. Its a complete thought experiment
        paradox. Novikov et al. used the example given by physicist <b>Joseph Polchinski</b> for 
        the grandfather paradox, that of a billiard ball heading toward a time machine. The 
        ball's older self emerges from the time machine and strikes its younger self so that its 
        younger self never enters the time machine. Novikov et al. So we can say that this 
        thought experiment was created by <b>Joseph Polchinski</b><br><br></p>

        <div class="points">There are a few solution for this Paradox<br>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2016 a computer scientist Doron Friedman developed a software such that
                    it would interpret the outcome of such a situation. The software tolded that
                    <b>Both the person that is you and your grandfather should possess a time 
                     machine. So that your grandfather could go in future to concieve his wife
                     before being killed. So in this way even if you killed him, the grandfather
                     knew his death and already sowed the seeds of your birth.</b>
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Another result is provided by Quantum Physics. There is a principle called 
                    Quantum Superposition. It says that <b>"At Quantum scale it is possible for 
                    a particle for be present at different position at the same instance of time"</b>
                    So using this concept scientist said that we travel to another universe which is 
                    in running in past as of our universe's present time. So when we will kill our grandfather we
                    will kill the one in another universe and not the one in our universe. In this way the 
                    resulting consequence would happen in that parallel universe and not in ours. This tells 
                    that our past is sealed and there is no way to chance it.

           <h1>6. Fermi Paradox</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="pr"><p> The Fermi Paradox explains all the possible reasons why we haven't found any intelligent life 
        in the universe. Fermi paradox is named after Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi. 
        There are billions of stars in the Milky Way similar to the Sun. With high probability, some of these stars have 
        Earth-like planets. Many of these stars, and hence their planets, are much older than the Sun. If the Earth is 
        typical, some may have developed intelligent life long ago. Some of these civilizations may have developed 
        interstellar travel, a step humans are investigating now. Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar 
        travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in a few million years. And since many of the stars 
        similar to the Sun are billions of years older, the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial 
        civilizations, or at least their probes. However, there is no convincing evidence that this has happened.</p>
    </div>
        
        <div class="pr"><p> There are roughly 10,000 galaxies for every grain of sand on earth. Even if we consider that 0.1% 
        planet have life there would be 1 million planets with life in milky way. Here are some speculation that 
        where are all the extraterrestrial life on the basis of The Great Filter</p><br>
        <div class="points">
        <ol>
            <li>The filter is behind us :
            <br>Maybe the evolution life itself is so much rare than not all can reach at this level. We maybe one of the 
                first if not the first civilization that has achieved this form of life. </li>
            <li>The filter is ahead of us : 
            <br>Thats a bad news for us. If the filter is ahead of us then we maybe near of getting eliminated. Maybe a 
                experiment that lights up all our atmosphere or a button that will serve humanity for rest of the years. 
                or the robotic AI killing their creator accidently or intensionally. If thats so then there might be some 
                secrets what are good not to be discovered. As after discovering or in an attempt to discover the secret 
                we may wipe the whole species all in once.
